# Getting Started with Kiwano

New to _Kiwano_? Youâ€™re in the right place! This guide will walk you through installation and getting ready to run speaker verification recipes.


## ðŸ“˜ About

**Kiwano** is an advanced open-source toolkit for **speaker verification**, built on **PyTorch** and designed to support both **academic research** and **real-world applications**.


### Main goals

- Provide a **modular**, **extensible**, and **reproducible** framework for speaker verification research.
- Support **cutting-edge speaker embedding architectures** including:
  - ResNet
  - ECAPA-TDNN
  - ECAPA2
  - ReDimNet
  - WavLM + MHFA
- Offer tools that streamline the **training, evaluation, and deployment** of verification systems.


### Tutorials

Kiwano aims to provide tutorials (coming soon) to guide you through:

- Setting up datasets
- Running your first recipe
- Customizing models and training parameters
- Implementing your own backends or scoring mechanisms



### Examples of use

Kiwano is designed for a variety of speaker verification use-cases, including:

- Academic experiments and benchmarks
- Industrial speaker recognition systems
- Robust evaluation pipelines for challenges or competitions
- Research on normalization and augmentation techniques

Whether you're building a baseline model or experimenting with novel architectures, Kiwano provides the tools to do it effectively.


## ðŸ›  Installation

Kiwano requires Python 3.8+ and PyTorch (GPU support recommended for training).

To install the lastest, Kiwano release, do:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrouvier/kiwano
```

### 2. Install required dependencies

```bash
cd kiwano
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Kiwano in editable mode


```bash
pip install -e .
```

This is an editable installation (-e option), meaning that your changes to the source code are automatically reflected when importing kiwano (no re-install needed).
